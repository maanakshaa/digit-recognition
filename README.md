# Handwritten Digit Recognition

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a deep learning model that can recognize handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset. The model uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to achieve high accuracy in digit classification. The system is trained on labeled image data and tested for its ability to correctly identify digits from unseen data.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for the project.
- **TensorFlow / Keras**: For developing and training the CNN model.
- **MNIST Dataset**: A widely-used dataset containing images of handwritten digits.

## Project Requirements

1. **Python Libraries**:
   - `tensorflow` - For building and training the CNN model.
   - `numpy`, `matplotlib` - For data handling and visualization.
   - `keras` - For constructing and training the neural network model.

2. **Hardware (for testing and deployment)**:
   - CPU/GPU for model training.
   - No specialized hardware is required for running the model on the MNIST dataset.
